        <h2><a id="Intro">Introduction/Background</a></h1>
          <br>
          The stock market is a complex adaptive system, consisting of individual components that interact in response to global events. 
          This makes predicting stock market trends a challenging yet crucial task for investors and financial institutions. 
          The large size of stock market historical data lends itself well to machine learning algorithms; however, no one has been 
          able to create a successful model as historical data is not enough. Others have tried to utilize news sentiment data instead 
          of historical data to make predictions, yet their models still fail. This project takes the unique approach of attempting to 
          combine both historical data and news sentiment in order to develop a machine learning model with the ability to forecast 
          short-term stock price movements for S&P 500 companies.
          <br>
          Recent studies have explored various machine learning approaches for stock prediction. Jiang et al. (2021) used LSTM networks 
          for stock price prediction incorporating news sentiment [1]. Patel et al. (2020) compared various machine learning techniques 
          for stock trend prediction [2]. Feng et al. (2019) developed a deep learning framework for stock prediction using technical 
          indicators and textual data [3]. 
          <br>
          We will use a combination of datasets: 
          <ul>
            <li>Yahoo Finance API for historical stock price data of S&P 500 companies</li>
            <li>Alpha Vantage News’ API for real-time and historical financial news articles[3]</li>
            <li> Potential other sources (best to worst):
              <ul>
                <li>Web Scraping Yahoo Finance’s top stories</li>
                <li>RSS feeds for quick (less accurate) data</li>
                <li>Financial Reports and SEC Filings to make predictions</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="Problem"><a id="Problem">Problem Definition</a></h2>
          Accurate stock market prediction is crucial for optimizing investment strategies, managing financial risks, 
          and understanding market dynamics. The challenge lies in developing a model that can effectively combine numerical 
          time series data with textual sentiment information to predict short-term (1-5 days) stock price movements. <br>
          <h3 id="Methods"><a id="Methods">Data Collection and Preprocessing</a></h3>
          We need two types of data: technical indicators and news articles for our stocks. In order to get technical indicators, 
          we utilized the yahoo finance API. This provided only basic stock details, so we implemented our own functions to 
          calculate more technical indicators for our stock. For news sentiment data, Alpha Vantage news was our source. 
          For each symbol, news articles were retrieved. Their text was cleaned and tokenized. Finally, we compute the sentiment, 
          polarity, and subjectivity of the article as separate features to use in our model. <br>
          Once we have obtained the data, we must preprocess it. For this stage of the project we wanted to simplify our data to 
          make debugging our model easier; therefore, PCA was employed. Although the number of features we had before using PCA 
          was not very high, reducing to the most important features did help with improving the visualization of the model.
          <h5>ML Models</h5>
          <ul>
            <li> LSTM Neural Network 
              <ul> <li> Useful for sequential data, this will be ideal for the relation of our data for the forecasting nature of our problem[1].</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li> Random Forest Classifier
              <ul> <li>Multiple decision trees, that outputs the mode, good for when data can be noisy as stocks can.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li> Support Vector Machine
              <ul> <li>Models used for classification and regression, good for classification of stock trends.</li></ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          At this stage of the project, our group has successfully implemented the Random Forest Classifier model. We chose to 
          implement this model for two main reasons: its ability to accurately predict non-linear patterns in data and its 
          resistance against overfitting. The stock market is an incredibly non-linear pattern with many factors at play; 
          therefore, the Random Forest Classifier model will perform better than other models in capturing those non-linear 
          patterns due to it being an ensemble of decision trees. Secondly, since stock market data can have a lot of noise 
          (random actions by investors), overfitting is a large concern of any stock predicting model. Random Forest Classifier, 
          however, does not have to worry about overfitting as much as other models because each decision tree trains on a 
          different subset of the data.

          Fill in once model is done
          <h5>Quantitative Measures</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Achieve an accuracy of at least 60% in predicting the direction of stock price movements</li>
            <li>Develop a model that outperforms a simple buy-and-hold strategy in terms of Sharpe Ratio (> 1.5)</li>
            <li>Mean Absolute Percentage Error for price predictions (≤ 5%)</li>
            <li>F1 Score, a harmonic mean of precision, for trend classification (≥ 0.65)</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Next Steps</h5>
          Now that we have fully implemented our first model, our next steps are to implement the other two. We plan to first 
          implement the LSTM Neural Network model and then finally implement the Support Vector Machine model. This order was 
          chosen based on the order this content will be taught in class, allowing us to use what we learn in lecture to more 
          effectively implement these models to our task.
